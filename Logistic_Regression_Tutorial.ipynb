        "\n",
        "Unlike **Linear Regression** which is used to predict a continuous numerical value. **Logistic Regression** is used to predict discrete catagories. Specifically, it predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain category, making it ideal for scenarios where you need to classify objects into two distinct groups, such as spam vs. non-spam emails, Salmon vs. Sea Bass, or Disease vs. Non-Disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "In **Linear Regression** we find a line of best using Least Squares as our cost function which enables us to find $ R^2 $ and its assciated $ p $ value. If you want more details on Linear Regression in the format of a Juypter Notebook click the adjacent link [different Tutorial](https://github.com/dkanh6/Machine_Learning_Examples/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Tutorial.ipynb).In **Logistic Regression** we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to create a sigmoidal \"Logistic Function\" (Heaviside) which plots the probability of a an input being apart of a specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a basic sense, a logistic regression only answers questions that have yes/no answers, or questtions that can be answered with 1 or 0, but can be extended to include multiple classes (Multinomal linear regression).\n"
